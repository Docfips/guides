# How-to Start with UnInbox!

1. Choose your Username. Click on the check box for the "I agree" then click on "I like it."

2. Create your passkey for password. ((For this, since I already have an account, I will do a password.)) Then "Create my Account".

3. ((If you created a passkey, I believe this step doesn't show up.)) If you use a password, you'll be asked to do a 2FA.
4. It gives you a recovery code that you should download, then will need to click on "I've saved my recovery code".
5.  Create or Join an "organization." If you are doing this for the first time, you need to create a new Org. If you are joining someone else's, you'll join. For this, I will be creating.
6. After you click to create your org, it now wants you to name it, and it will give you an Org shortcode. After you name it, you'll "Make my org.."

7. Put in a name or image if you want. Or you can skip.
8. This is the splash screen for onboarding. At the moment, the video is not populating, but that will be changed later. Either watch the video (when its posted) or/after click on "Take me to my account."

9. ### THIS IS THE IMPORTANT STEP THAT YOU WILL GET AN ERROR WITHOUT DOING!!!
   Once you are brought to your main page, you need to align an email with your organization, or you won't be able to email.

  9a. Click on the org name on the bottom left, then click on your settings.

  9b. Click on the "Personal Addresses" tab, which will give you two options. You can either claim your free email `@uninbox.me` or, if you paid for premium tier, you can click on claim for `@uninme`.

  9c. Once you claim, you'll get a `Warning` box that tells you that this email will be associated with this particular organization. Click on "Add to this org."
